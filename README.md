MiniProject4
============

Completed Mini Project 4. Project requirements can be found here: http://www3.nd.edu/~cse/2013fa/40814/projects.html


Project Guidelines:

In this fourth mini project, you will take your app and add the ability to take pictures (and if you wish to do so, videos and voice recordings). At the minimum, your app should do the following:
Allow the app to take pictures or select a photo from the photos on the device.
Geo-tag the photo and show on the map where a photo has been taken (e.g., a pin indicates that a photo has been taken and when you select the pin, the photo shows).
Perform simple manipulation with the photo such as zooming, scaling, cropping, or changing the color depth, etc. (only one of these features is required).
Show a list of all images taken with a thumbnail of the image.
